# Unity AmbientCG Importer
acg-importer is a Unity package that simplifies the process of importing textures into Unity from AmbientCG.

https://github.com/z3lx/acg-importer/assets/57017122/73854723-4e87-405b-9f0d-1cba4ec6deda

## Features
- **Unity Custom Editor**: Utilize a custom editor within Unity for a user-friendly experience, complete with tooltips for more information.
- **Single and Bulk Import Options**: Import materials and textures individually or in bulk through both single and batch ZIP imports.
- **AmbientCG NextCloud Support**: Bulk import files downloaded via [Nextcloud](https://docs.ambientcg.com/patreon-rewards/nextcloud/downloading), an AmbientCG Patreon-only feature that allows for easier batch downloading.
- **Shader Flexibility**: Compatible out of the box with HDRP, URP, and BiRP lit shaders, as well as any custom shaders by adjusting shader properties during the import process.
- **Optimized Texture Handling**: Save only required textures and generate new swizzled ones when necessary depending on the shader properties.
